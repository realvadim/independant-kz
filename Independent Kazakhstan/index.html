				<h1>Acquisition of independence</h1>				
				<p>On <span class="highlight">16 December 1986</span>, the Soviet Politburo dismissed the long serving Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, Dinmukhamed Konayev. His successor was Gennady Kolbin from Ulyanovsk, Russia. This caused demonstrations protesting this move. These demonstrations were violently suppressed by the authorities, "between two and twenty people lost their lives, and between 763 and 1137 received injuries. Between 2212 and 2336 demonstrators were arrested". Later, in <span class="highlight">September 1989</span>, Kolbin was replaced with a Kazakh, Nursultan Nazarbayev.</p>
				<p>In <span class="highlight">June 1990</span>, Moscow declared formally the sovereignty of the central government, forcing Kazakhstan to elaborate its own statement of sovereignty. The statement was adopted in <span class="highlight">October 1990</span>.</p>
				<p>In keeping with practices in other republics at that time, the parliament had named Nazarbayev its chairman, and then, soon afterward, it had converted the chairmanship to the presidency of the republic. Nazarbayev remained strongly committed to the perpetuation of the Soviet Union throughout the spring and summer of <span class="highlight">1991</span>. He took this position largely because he considered the republics too interdependent economically to survive separation.</p>
				<p>Gorbachev's authority crumbled rapidly throughout <span class="highlight">1991</span>. Nazarbayev, however, continued to support him, persistently urging other republic leaders to sign the revised Union Treaty, which Gorbachev had put forward in a last attempt to hold the Soviet Union together.</p>
				<p>Because of the coup attempted in Moscow against the Gorbachev government in <span class="highlight">August 1991</span>, the Union Treaty never was signed. Ambivalent about the removal of Gorbachev, Nazarbayev did not condemn the coup attempt until its second day. However, once the incompetence of the plotters became clear, Nazarbayev for the continuation of some form of union, largely because of his conviction that independence would be economic suicide.</p>
				<p>At the same time, however, Nazarbayev pragmatically began preparing his republic for much greater freedom, if not for actual independence. He appointed professional economists and managers to high posts, and he began to seek the advice of foreign development and business experts. Nazarbayev solidified his position by winning an uncontested election for president in <span class="highlight">December 1991</span>.</p>
				<p>A week after the election, Nazarbayev became the president of an independent state when the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed documents dissolving the Soviet Union.  On the <span class="highlight">December 21</span> eleven of the fifteen Soviet republics announced the expansion of the CIS. This document became known as Alma-Ata Declaration. On <span class="highlight">16 December 1991</span>, just five days before that declaration, Kazakhstan had become the last of the republics to proclaim its independence.</p>					
				<p>Nursultan Nazarbayev took several effective steps to ensure his position. The constitution of <span class="highlight">1993</span> made the prime minister and the Council of Ministers responsible solely to the president, and in <span class="highlight">1995</span> a new constitution reinforced that relationship. Nazarbayev gained substantial popularity by limiting the economic shock of separation from the Soviet Union and by maintaining ethnic harmony in the highly diverse country with more than 100 different nationalities.</p>
